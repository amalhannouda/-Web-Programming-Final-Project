  <h1>Maha Shivaratri Festival</h1>
<p>Maha Shivaratri Festival is the most important event in the Hindu spiritual calendar. During this annual festival, <b style="color:blue;">devotees glorify and revere the life of Lord Shiva</b>. They worship lingam (symbol of Shiva), observe night fast and meditate on several ethics during the festival. It is celebrated on <b>the fourteenth day of the waning moon</b> in the Nepali month of Falgun <b>(February/March)</b>. During this day, the Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu witnesses a huge influx of devotees and Sadhus (holy sages) offering their worship. Married women in Nepal pray for the welfare of their husbands. However, unmarried girls offer their worship to find a husband like Lord Shiva who is considered as the ideal husband.</p>
<p>Unlike most Hindu festivals, Maha Shivaratri is not just an obviously joyful festival to feast on. On the contrary, he sees the idea of <b>​​self-reflection</b> and personal growth leaving behind everything that hinders our success.</p>
