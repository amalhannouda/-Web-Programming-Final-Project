<h1>Dashain and Tihar Festivals</h1>
<p>Dashain and Tihar are two of the <b style="color:blue;">greatest festivals</b> of Nepal.
According to Hindus mythology, Dashain is a celebration of the victory of the goddess Durga over the evil Mahishasura. while Tihar is a celebration of lights and colors dedicated to the god of wealth and prosperity Laxmi.
Although these festivals are linked to a particular religion, all Nepali people celebrate Dashain and Tihar with great joy and excitement.</p>
<p>Both of these festivals fall during <b style="color:blue;">the fall season</b> in the month of Ashwin <b>(September- October)</b> and are considered the longest festival holidays. Nepal people celebrate Dashain- also called <i>Vijaya Dashami</i>- for <b style="color:blue;">10 days</b> by spending time with their family and friends, eating delicious foods and receiving tika and blessings from the elderly. Just after Dashain, Tihar is celebrated for <b style="color:blue;">five days</b>. It is the festival on which Nepalese people worship dogs for their loyalty, offering them garlands and good food. Further, the last day of Tihar- Bhaitika, celebrates the bond of a brother and sisterâ€™s relationship. It is called also <i>festival of lights and flowers</i> because the cities and the surroundings look very clean and wonderful with the smell and presence of the marigold flowers during the festival.</p>
