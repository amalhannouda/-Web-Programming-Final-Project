<h1>Gai Jatra Festival</h1>
  <p>Gai Jatra is a festival of dancing, singing, merriment and laughter. The word <b style="color:blue;">"Gai" means Cow</b> in English. The Cow Festival is celebrated in the Kathmandu Valley to commemorate the death of loved ones. As part of the festival, children dress up as cows and parade through the streets. The festival usually falls in  <b style="color:blue;">July or August</b>.
Gai Jatra is a time for remembering the lost and also for relieving pain. The cow is considered the goddess of wealth in the Hindu religion. Sharing the grief and taking comfort in the knowledge that their departed are safe is the real reason to celebrate this festival.</p>
<p> In Bhaktapur, the festival lasts for eight days. The origin of this celebration dates back to <b><i>the reign of the Malla rulers</i></b>. Queen Malla is said to have been in mourning for a long time after the untimely death of her son. The king, in an attempt to console her, asked each family that had lost a loved one to come out in procession to show the queen that they were not alone in their suffering.</p>
