    <h1>Shree Krishna Janmashtami Festival</h1>
<p>Shree Krishna Janmashtami, a Hindu festival that celebrates <b style="color:blue;">the birth (Janma) of Lord Krishna</b> on the <b>eighth (Ashtami)</b> day of the dark two weeks of the month of Bhadrabada (August-September). The number eight has another significance in Krishna myth as it is the <b><i>eighth child of his mother</i></b>, Devaki.</p>
<p>The Festival is <b><i>very popular</i></b> in Nepal and throughout the Hindu world. It is meant to commemorate the eighth birth, or "avatar", of God Krishna. It is celebrated as a general victory of good over evil. Hindu epic tales tell of Krishna's battles with evil beings and his ultimate victory over the forces of darkness. The biggest celebration of this Hindu festival is held in <b><i>Mathura and Vrindavan</i></b>, where Lord Krishna is believed to have been born and spent his growing up years.</p>
