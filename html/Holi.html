  <h1>Fagu Purnima festival (Holi)</h1>
<p>Fagu Purnima or <b style="color:blue;">festival of color, friendship and love</b>. Holi takes place on the night of Falgun Krishna Chaturdasi <b>the day after the full moon (Purnima)</b> according to the Hindu calendar. It is the time to obtain a blessing from God for the coming harvests and the fertility of the land. This festival is celebrated in most counties of South Asia, not only in Nepal.</p>
<p>Preparations for Holi in Nepal start a week before. The tradition is to erect a long bamboo pole covered with different colored fabrics (locally called Chir) in Basantapur, Durbar Square. On the eve of Holi, the bamboo pole (lingo) is cut down and the bamboo pole (chir) is burned. This occasion is known as Holika Dahan or Chir Haran.</p>
<p>The Holi festival is celebrated with <b>colors, music, dance, sweets and especially with water</b>. The participants color each other, and it is a token of love. People go from house to house of relatives and friends in groups during the celebration. Some people also play music and dance during this festival. People collect wood to light up the alleys of villages and towns while playing music and dancing. This is considered an essential part of the Holi festival, it symbolizes the end of Holi (Holika Dahan).</p>
